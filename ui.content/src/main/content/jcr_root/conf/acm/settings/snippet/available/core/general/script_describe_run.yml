  Describes the script characteristics like input arguments for manual scripts.
  
  This method is executed before the script is run and is used to define the script's input inputs.<br>
  The arguments must be defined using the `inputs.xxx(name) { ... }` methods which could be later on used in the script by calling `inputs.value(name)` method.<br>
