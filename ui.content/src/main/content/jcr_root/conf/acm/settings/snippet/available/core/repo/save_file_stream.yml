  Creates or updates a file at the specified path in the repository.
  
  To work directly with `OutputStream` using the standard AEM API requires significant boilerplate.
  This method streamlines the process by allowing direct writing to an output stream via a closure.
  
  For example:
  ```groovy
  repo.get("/content/dam/acme/en/posts/hello-world.yml").saveFile("application/x-yaml") { output ->
    formatter.yml.write(output, [
        title: "Hello World",
        description: "This is a sample post.",
        tags: ["sample", "post"]
    ])
  }
  ```
