  Execute the script only if it has never been executed before, content changed, or the last execution has not been successful.
  
  Control the number of retries by setting the `maxCount` parameter. 
  It is also possible to skip the parameter, in which case the default value of `1` will be used.
  
  For example:
  ```groovy
  condition.retryChanged()
  condition.retryChanged(3)
  ```
