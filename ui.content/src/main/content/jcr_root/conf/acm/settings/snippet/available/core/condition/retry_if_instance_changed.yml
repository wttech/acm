  condition.retryIfInstanceChanged()
documentation: |
  Execute the script only if the previous execution failed and the instance has changed due to a deployment, such as an instance restart or an OSGi bundle change.
  
  This condition combined with `contentChanged()` is especially useful for content upgrade scripts.
  
  For example:
  ```groovy
  boolean canRun() {
    return condition.idleSelf() && (condition.contentChanged() || condition.retryIfInstanceChanged())
  }
  
  void doRun() {
    println("I should run when content changes or when the instance changes after a failure!")
  }
  ```
