  Determines whether the script is eligible for execution.
  Allows to skip execution (and history entries) based on any conditions, such as the script author, changes in the repository, or previous execution results.
  
  This method is called after `describeRun()` and before `doRun()`.
  
  **For console or manual execution**, typically define as:
  ```groovy
  boolean canRun() {
    return conditions.always()
  }
  ```
  
  **For automatic execution**, usually define to run only once:
  ```groovy
  boolean canRun() {
      return conditions.once()
  }
  ```
  
  **Or until the script succeeds**:
  ```groovy
  boolean canRun() {
      return conditions.notSucceeded()
  }
  ```
  
  All conditions could be combined with logical operators:
  ```groovy
  boolean canRun() {
      return conditions.isInstanceAuthor() && (conditions.changed() || conditions.notSucceeded())
  }
  ```
