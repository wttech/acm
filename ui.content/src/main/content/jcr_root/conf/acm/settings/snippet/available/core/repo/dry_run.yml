  repo.dryRun(${1:enabled}) {
    // operations

documentation: |
  Allow to perform operations on the repository in two modes:
  - dry run (when enabled) - operations are not committed to the repository, but can be previewed in the logs,
  - normal run (when disabled) - operations are committed to the repository.
  
  When exception is thrown during dry run, the revert operation is performed, so no changes are made to the repository.
  Useful especially when combined with `arguments.bool("dryRun")` to allow user to choose whether to perform dry run or not.
  
  For example:
  ```groovy
  void describeRun() {
    arguments.bool("dryRun") { value = true; switcher(); description = "Do not commit changes to the repository" }
  }
  
  boolean canRun() {
    return condition.idleSelf()
  }
    
  void doRun() { 
    out.fromLogs()
    repo.dryRun(arguments.value("dryRun")) {
      repo.get("/content/acme").ensureFolder()
    }
  }
  ```
