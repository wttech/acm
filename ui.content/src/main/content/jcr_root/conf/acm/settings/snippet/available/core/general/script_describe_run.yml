  Describes the script characteristics.
  
  This method is executed before the script is run and is used to define the script's input arguments.<br>
  The arguments must be defined using the `arguments.xxx(name) { ... }` methods which could be later on used in the script by calling `arguments.value(name)` method.<br>
