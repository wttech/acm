  Execute the script only once per its path.

  When the script content is changed, the script will be executed again.<br>
  When the instance is changed due to a deployment, such as an instance restart or an OSGi bundle change and the script previously failed, the script will be executed again.

  Alias for `conditions.contentChanged() || conditions.retryIfInstanceChanged()`.

  The most universal and recommended condition to use for automatic scripts.
