Main concepts of AEM Content Manager tool are:

* **Simplicity**
    * Creating migration scripts should be as much simple as it is possible (no need to learn custom YML syntax or configuration language, just well-known Groovy),
    * No extra configuration needed - no hooks to needed to be configured in an AEM build (just provide Groovy scripts, the tool will do the rest),
* **Stability**
    * Executed always at optimal moment - safely use any classes from any OSGi bundles including your own,

## Installation

The ready-to-install AEM packages are available on [GitHub releases](https://github.com/wttech/acm/releases).

There are two ways to install AEM Content Manager on your AEM instances:

1. Using the 'all' package:
    * Recommended for fresh AEM instances.
    * This package will also install AEM Groovy Console and AEM Content Manager examples.
2. Using the 'minimal' package:
    * Recommended for AEM instances that already contain some dependencies shared with other tools.
    * This package does not include Groovy bundles, which can be provided by other tools like [AEM Easy Content Upgrade](https://github.com/valtech/aem-easy-content-upgrade/releases) (AECU) or [AEM Groovy Console](https://github.com/orbinson/aem-groovy-console/releases).

## Compatibility

| AEM Content Manager | AEM        | Java  | Groovy |
|---------------------|------------|-------|--------|
| 1.0.0               | 6.5, cloud | 8, 11 | 4.x    |

Note that AEM Content Manager is using Groovy scripts concept. However it is **not** using [AEM Groovy Console](https://github.com/icfnext/aem-groovy-console). It is done intentionally, because Groovy Console has close dependencies to concrete AEM version.
AEM Content Manager tool is implemented in a AEM version agnostic way, to make it more universal and more fault-tolerant when AEM version is changing.
It is compatible with AEM Groovy Console - simply install one of AEM Content Manager distributions without Groovy console OSGi bundle included as it is usually provided by Groovy Console AEM package.

2. Do code changes on a feature branch created from *main* branch.
3. Create a pull request with a base of *main* branch.

## Building

To build all the modules run in the project root directory the following command with Maven 3:

    sh mvnw clean install

To build all the modules and deploy the `all` package to a local instance of AEM, run in the project root directory the following command:

    sh mvnw clean install -PautoInstallSinglePackage

Or to deploy it to a publish instance, run

    sh mvnw clean install -PautoInstallSinglePackagePublish

Or alternatively

    sh mvnw clean install -PautoInstallSinglePackage -Daem.port=4503

Or to deploy only the bundle to the author, run

    sh mvnw clean install -PautoInstallBundle

Or to deploy only a single content package, run in the sub-module directory (i.e `ui.apps`)

    sh mvnw clean install -PautoInstallPackage
