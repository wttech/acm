  The path picker allows users to browse and select paths from the JCR repository.
  It can be configured to restrict the selection to a specific root path, either inclusive or exclusive which means the root path itself can be selected or not.

  For example:
  ```groovy
  inputs.path("contentPath")
  inputs.path("thumbnailPath") { rootPathExclusive = "/content/dam"; description = "Asset to use as page thumbnail" }
  inputs.path("templatePath") { rootPathExclusive = "/conf/acme/settings/wcm/templates"; description = "Template to use for page creation" }
  inputs.path("pagePath") { rootPathInclusive = "/content"; description = "Pages to export" }
  ```
